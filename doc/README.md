Dimecoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Dimecoin Core is the original Dimecoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Dimecoin transactions (which is currently more than 10 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Dimecoin Core, visit [dimecoinnetwork.com](https://dimecoinnetwork.com/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Dimecoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix
