Changes
    
    * Prevent old uncompatible peers to connect (they don't sync after block 3054011 after 10000 mined blocks by new core). This is a temporary workaround before a proper PROTO_VERSION upgrade.
    * Connects to new stable and up to date nodes and seeders
    * Rename from Dimecoin-Qt to Dimecoin Core
    * reset testnet
    * added new checkpoints
    * using QT 5.5

Note : required update for nodes, block explorers, exchanges and miner pools

If you want to stop getting old peers that sometimes prevent you syncing, you must upgrade

Note : As always, backup your wallet before upgrading
